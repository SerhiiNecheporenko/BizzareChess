# BizzareChess
I decide to create the real useful project - The Chess Game + Neural Network upgrade in the future. Maybe, I hope. Because it's the better way to discovering Python code - Excites me a lot.

Well, that guy from YouTube 3 short videos of how to build a code for Chess Game, wasn't impressing. As always, like most russian coderes, they are mostly bad teachers.
As a result, I'm reading careful very clear & simple tutorial from GitHub creating in same time a project. Thanx them!
